# Portfolio

A portfolio website application showcasing my recent and significant projects.

- Code was built using the React.js framework, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to set up the main front-end graphical user interface.
- Navigation will snap to the desired section using DOM manipulation.
- Contact form with email capabilities was built using third-party API, EmailJS.
- Site was deployed through Heroku and SiteGround.
